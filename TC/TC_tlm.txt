#Defining a new source of telemetry, for CFS, given new name, nature of the unit coming down, give it a name
#path for both ~/cfs_demo/config/targets/CFS/cmd_tlm
#at the start of the source append an item, call it this, here's what it is, this value, name, nature
#then follow up with normal append items with these CCSDS values
#should have an append for each structure defined in app_msg.h (tlmheader, uscmdcnt, uscmderrcnt)
#should match the housekeeping telemetry packet in application
